Thank you for installing HashiCorp Waypoint!

Waypoint will take a few minutes to bootstrap. Once it is bootstrapped, you
can log in to the local CLI by running the following command. If this command
fails, please wait a few more minutes and try again.

  $ waypoint login -from-kubernetes

Once logged in, you can use the "waypoint ui" command to open the web interface.
Alternately, you can visit the address of the load balancer service configured.

If anything fails to configure properly you can uninstall this release:

  $ helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }}
{{- else }}
{{- if (eq (.Values.runner.enabled | toString) "true") }}
You've successfully installed a HashiCorp Waypoint runner!

The runner should start in a few minutes. You can look for the runner to register
with the server using the "waypoint runner list" command. If you did not supply
a runner token ahead of time, you may have to adopt the runner using the
UI or the "waypoint runner adopt" command.

If the runner does not show up in the runner list output, you can debug it
by looking at the logs for the runner pod that was just launched.
